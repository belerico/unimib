# Alternatives to inverted file structure

## Suffix tree structure

Used to index alphanumeric sequences (genetic data)
Basic notions:

- document seen as unique string
- index points are selected within the text based on the lexicographical oreder of the tokens
- each position in the text from index point to the end is a **suffix**
- each suffix is uniquely identified
- suffix pointers stored in the leaves 

Pros:

- suitable for complexes serches

Cons:

- expensive construction phase
- Increase in the size of index

## Suffix array

Two arrays:

- Suffix array: contains the index points
- Super index

## Signature structure (Bit mask)

We use the has table, and the idea is to:

- divide document into **blocks of fixed lengths**
- assign each block to a **signature** used to search, by matching the document signature with the query signature

So, we got an hash function **h** that maps terms into masks of B bits, named signature
The text is partioned into blocks of b terms; each block is associated with a signature obtined combining the signatures of every terms appearing in the block, combined by the OR operator
We search the query term by checking if its signature is **included** in the signature of the documents

Pros:

- less memory required
- suitable for not too big texts
- suitable for multimedia indexing

Cons:

- sequetial search
- false drops

Finally: 

- Speed of access: $\text{signature} \ll \text{suffix array} \ll \text{inverted file}$
- Memory capacity: $\text{inverted file} \ll \text{suffix array} \gg \text{signature}$

# Boolean model

Based on set theory: all docs is represented as set of index terms --> **binary weights** associated with index terms
$R(d_j) = \{t_i | w_{ij} = 1\}, w_{ij} \in \{0,1\}$
A query is represented as a boolean expression on terms, so the matchinga mechanism applies set operations
**Relevance** is modeled as binary property of documents: retrieval status values either 0 or 1
Each boolean query is modeled in a **disjunctive normal form**
The evaluation order is important from the highest importance:

1. ADJ, NEAT
2. AND, NOT
3. OR

The evaluation is made by a binary evaluation tree (recursively)
For efficiency we use the **lazy evaluation mode**
