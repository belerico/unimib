# Word embeddings

We need to create a dense matrix that represents words in our vocabulary, that is not large and sparse.
We need to construct a cooccurence matrix, and then reduce it
We count the number of time each context word cooccurs:

- window of a particular size
- with word of interest

we obtain a co-occurence matrix (windows based)
target words are on the rows
