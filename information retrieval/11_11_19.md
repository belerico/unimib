## Limitations of boolean models

- Exact comparison
- its not able to produce a ranking of the results

# Vector space model

its based on linear algebra and represents both docs and queries in a n-dimensional vector space, where n is the total number of index terms.
A document $d_j$ is represented by means of a weighting vector $w_{ij}$, ovvero $R(d_j) = \overrightarrow{\rm w} = (w_{1j}, w_{2j}, ..., w_{nj})$, where $w_{ij} \in \{0,1\} \lor \mathbb{R}_+$
A query is generellay expressed as list of words and is represented as a vector of weights (1 if word is present, 0 if is not), so $R(q) = \overrightarrow{\rm q} = (q_{1j}, q_{2j}, ..., q_{nj})$, where $w_{ij} \in \{0,1\}$
Each vector in space is a **linear combination** of the n vectors associated with the terms
We assume that the vector space is **orthonormal**
