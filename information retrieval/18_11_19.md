# Probabilistic models

topical relevance: is a property of docs to have a topic which is relevant to the user; its computation is based on the adoption of a model: different models compute relevance in a different way (binary, vector similarity and probabilistic)

Why probabilistic model? Because boolean and vector models do not explicity account for uncertainty in retrieval process

# Language model

unigram language model: probability distr over words in a language
n-gram language model: probability distr over n words in a language

# Binary independence model

## Probability ranking principle
