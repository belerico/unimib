Different types of ontologies

- Tesauri, lexical ontologies: designed for NLP, defines a dictionary for a language, specifying linguistic entities (noun, verb, ...), words and a fixed number of relations between words (synonyms, hypernyms, ...)
- Taxonomies: classification structure for objects in a given domains, tipically a tree based structure; animal species for example
- Axiomatic ontologies: formal specification of a coceptualization with  a language L, with a set of axioms and a formal semantics: theory in a logic sense

ProtegÃ© --> costruire un ontologia

ontologies could be considered as a schema for a knowledge engine, and while in a relational database schema is highly correlated and tipizzato with the underline data, the relation with the schema and the data is loose: schema do not need to preexist
Ontologies are used to reason about the data

We need decidable and efficient formal languages (predicative languages are undecidable): RDF
We focus on description logics, that are at the basis on OWL2

# RDF Schema

- Introduction of Classes: group of individuals. Distinction between classes and instances
- Resource
- Literal
