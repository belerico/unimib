# datalog

reason about individuals
which cluase are a logical conseq of a kb?
logical consenq are indipendent of our interpretation

* **variables**: capital case, universally quantified
* **query**: ask if body is logical conseq of a kb, answer is an **instance** of the kb or **no**: substitution of variables that make true the query
* an atom g is a **logical conseq** if 
  * g is a fact
  * thre's a rule g <-- b1 and b2 and ... and bk in kb st each bi is a logical conseq of kb
I create all the possible substitution for al the possible variables, that's because if we don't have a constant appearing in any formula we can't have proofs (**propositionalization**)

How to debug a kb?
we essentially trace back the proof recursively

# knowledge graphs

Big data because:

* velocity
* volume
* variety
* veracity: capacity to deal with uncertaint things

datalog has n-ary predicates that a kg doesn't have: in a kg one can't reason about time
