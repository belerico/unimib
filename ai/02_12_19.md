# Knowledge graph embeddings

Map entities and relations into a vector space
Link prediction is not logical inference, that's because logical inference is only based on the recursive application of interpretation
You loose recursion and logical information when you map into a vector space
Why cool?
- There's a mapping between logic and deeo learning
- Representations of entities are useful and intuitive
Why a mess?
- No standard
