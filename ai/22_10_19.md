# Reinforcement learning

Adaptive traffic light: regulate traffic lights
Context: single four-way intersection
Using a valide simultaiton of real traffic. The environment can be controlled

## Q learning
Estimate the value of a situation considering the immediate reward plus a discount factor multiplied by the next best action value. Therefore we have a Q function Q(s, a) giving the value of an action given a state. Action selection policy actually based on greedy exploration policy. Accumulate rewards exploring.

If you want to approximate a function (Q function, very high combinatorial), you can use **Deep Learning**. A **NN** can approximate environment model: the best approach is **try and error** with different architectures. DL allows to simulate different environments and actions in order to predict an action value in a general situation. 

Starting point: You are generating a lot of simulations.
