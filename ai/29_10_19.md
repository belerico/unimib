We understand RDFs semantics due to simple rules
We want enrich the language
Limitations of RDFS:

- No localized ranges and domains: domain restriction is global, for a property we can specify only one domain or range; if we specify two range or domain those will be interpreted as both true
- No cardinality
- No transisitive, inverse and simmetrical properties (RDFS++)
- No disjoint classes
- No boolean combinations of classes

With OWL you can import and extend an ontologies, you can annotate ontologie with natural language

**OWL 2 vs OWL 1**, there're some differences (check it manually)

Two main approches to assign meaning to ontologies:

1. direct semantics --> description logic
2. rdf based semantics

In DL we'll only have only few types of axioms and it's a conceptual language, we focus on the definitions of concepts: what is a person, what is a class and so on. Another reason for the popularity of DL is that is very modular: you can add constructs that you need.
With the DL that we're using we can also reason on literals such as date and numbers.

# DL System Architecture
No strict distinction between schema and data
The knowledge abse is made of two parts:

- TBOX: Terminological box. We put the definitions of terminology (concepts). We define classes as subset or equivalent to another class. It chages a little
- ABOX: Assertional box . Two kinds of assertions: we can say that an individual is a member of class, or we can say that a pair is memeber to a certain relation. It chages a lot

Semantic net: diagrams or structure to represent semantics
If you want to give semantics to semantic net you end up defining a logic

# Class/concepts constructors

Roles --> predicates / properties
Concepts --> classes
