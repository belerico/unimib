# How to build a knowledge base?

- Ingest data from texts (long or short)
- Ingest data from structured sources eg tables

## Semi structured data extraction

There're a lot of tables on the web, the structure can be difficult in the schema: splitted columns and so on
We can normalize the structure 
The idea is that if we provide sematic annotations we can treat tables as linked data
Semantic annotations are annotations that give us the power to align data from tables to a knowledge graph, in addition we want to infer the predicate that links columns together
Align schema of the table to an ontology
Instance level reconcilation: we want to understand that a particular cell refers to instance of a knowledge graph

# From signals to knowledge

Named entity recognition and linking
- NER: we want to find named entities in a text (person, company, place, etc.)
- NEL: linking named entities found in a text (mentions) to entities described in a knowledge base
  
Why? for integrate structured and unstructured data, marketing
Machine reading is a task that read a text and build the knowledge base associated with it: we need relation extraction (anaphora resolution)

- different techniques: 
  - nlp with deep parsing
  - machine learning (statistical analysis of frequent patterns)
  - vocabulary-based
- open information extraction vs closed information extraction
- often combined, also depending on the features of the input text
